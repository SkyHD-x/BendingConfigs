        Firebenders possess the power to infuse color when they breathe, it''s unclear
        how they do this, but some suggest it can be obtained by saying "Bring fire
        and light together as one and allow the breath of color" and can be brought
        back to normal by saying "Split the bond of fire and light and set the color
        free".'

        the bender to be holding a bottle of water or a water bucket. To start healing
        simply sneak, however if the bender is targeting a mob while sneaking, the
        bender will heal the targeted mob.
